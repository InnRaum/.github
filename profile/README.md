## InnRaum Project

In InnRaum³, companies can discover and use the potential of digital technologies and tools in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment to ensure their connectivity to an economy characterized by transformation. The focus areas of artificial intelligence / digital technologies (Passau), robotics (Ried), sensor technology (Schärding) and the associated equipment at the individual locations complement each other.

InnRaum³ offers interested SMEs and start-ups uncomplicated access to technologies that are intended to encourage them to try out and prototype innovative and future-oriented solutions. The respective equipment at the three locations can be booked reciprocally, so that simplified cross-border use is possible.
